# Twitter Bot Filtering

## Intro & Motivation
This repository contains code to help filter out some Twitter bots.

Tweets from Twitter bots can make it extremely challenging to find meaningful signals in Twitter data. There are a wide range of purposes of Twitter bots; some are benevolent bots that share information about weather and job postings. Others are more nefarious and deceptive, attempting to influence elections or direct people to porn sites.

A number of researchers have used labeled data sets to create classifiers to try to identify certain types of bots. Sometimes, though, it's helpful to have some simpler filtering mechanisms.

The code in this repository is a work in progress, and will ultimately contain several reasonably fast methods of filtering out Tweets from bots.
